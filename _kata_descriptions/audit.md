## Audit everything
The `Audit` project is an audit system that keeps track of all visitors in an organization.
It : 
* uses flat text files as underlying storage with the structure shown below
* system appends the visitorâ€™s name and the time of their visit to the end of the most recent file
    - When the maximum number of entries per file is reached: a new file with an `incremented index` is created

This is actually a refactoring kata. 
The starting position is available on Github [here](https://github.com/katalogs/audit-kata).
