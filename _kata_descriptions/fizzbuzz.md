# FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.
But for multiples of three print "Fizz" instead of the
number and for the multiples of five print "Buzz". For
numbers which are multiples of both three and five
print "FizzBuzz".

Sample output:

	1
	2
	Fizz
	4
	Buzz
	Fizz
	7
	8
	Fizz
	Buzz
	11
	Fizz
	13
	14
	FizzBuzz
	16
	17
	Fizz
	19
	Buzz
	... etc up to 100

## Follow-up requirements

When you have the above program working, extend it with the following rules:

- Multiples of 7 are "Whizz"
- Multiples of 11 are "Bang"

That means that multiples of 3 & 7 will be "FizzWhizz", multiples of 5 & 11 will be "BuzzBang" etc. Your program should be configurable for which multiples are being used. 

Also, extend your printout so it continues either to 100 or until the first time you get a word with a part for every factor. For example, if you have all of 3,5,7,11 enabled, it should stop at "FizzBuzzWhizzBang", 1155.

Additional rules you could also add:

- Multiples of 13 are "Split"
- Multiples of 17 are "Pop"
