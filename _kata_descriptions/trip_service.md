# {{ page.title}}

This is a refactoring kata simulating legacy code with the hard to test TripService class.

### Acknowledgments
The [Trip Service Kata](https://github.com/sandromancuso/trip-service-kata) is from Sandro Mancuso. He even has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NnElPO5BU0),
where he incrementally does the refactoring while explaining all the steps.
