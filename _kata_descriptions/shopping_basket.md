Shopping Basket Discount
========================

Items in a shopping basket have a unit price and quantity. Write code that will allow you to:

- find out the quantity of a particular item in the basket 
- calculate the total price of the whole basket, including any applicable discount 

Normally the total price is the sum of unit price * quantity for all the items. If you buy in bulk you get a discount:

- If total basket value > $100, apply a 5% discount
- If total basket value > $200, apply a 10% discount

## Example

- Item A: price $10, quantity 5
- Item B: price $25, quantity 2
- Item C: price $9.99, quantity 6

This basket qualifies for a 5% discount and the total price is $151.94. The total number of items is 13, of which 6 are item C.

I got this kata from Jason Gorman but I have changed it slightly.
