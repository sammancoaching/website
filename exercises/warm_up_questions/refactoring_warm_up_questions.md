|   |                                                                                                                           |True|False|
|---|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----|-----|
|  1| Refactoring work should be planned and prioritized alongside user stories for the sprint.                                 |    |     |
|  2| When someone is refactoring the code may be broken for a few days while they do it.                                       |    |     |
|  3| Code reviews generate refactoring tasks in the backlog.                                                                   |    |     |
|  4| If you encounter ugly code it is your moral duty to refactor it.                                                          |    |     |
|  5| The team lead does most of the refactoring, others should only refactor when they are told to.                            |    |     |
|  6| Large changes, for example switching cloud provider, can be done through a sequence of small refactoring steps.           |    |     |
|  7| If you see duplication in the code you should use refactoring to remove it.                                               |    |     |
|  8| If you don’t understand the code you shouldn’t refactor it.                                                               |    |     |
|  9| You should refactor in a code branch and have QA test it to confirm you haven't broken anything before merging to master. |    |     |
| 10| If you encounter ugly code that you don’t need to change to get your task done, then you don’t need to refactor it.       |    |     |
| 11| You should get permission from your manager before refactoring.                                                           |    |     |
| 12| When we invest time in refactoring it saves us time overall.                                                              |    |     |
| 13| It’s not possible to refactor the database if you use an Object Relational Mapper (ORM).                                                             |    |     |
| 14| A good time to refactor is before you add a new feature to make adding it easier.                                         |    |     |
| 15| Refactoring can impact performance so you should profile your code after refactoring.                                     |    |     |
| 16| The purpose of refactoring is to make you write code faster.                                                              |    |     |
| 17| You can’t refactor a library or published API.                                                                            |    |     |
| 18| You should refactor well-designed code not just ugly code.                                                                |    |     |
| 19| Refactoring is a way of paying off technical debt.                                                                        |    |     |
| 20| You can only refactor if you have test coverage over 80%.                                                                 |    |     |
