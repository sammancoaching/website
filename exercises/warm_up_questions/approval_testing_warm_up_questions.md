|  1| As a rule of thumb, unit tests should contain only _one_ assertion in each test case. |    |     |
|  2| Approval testing is defined by the ISTQB standards organization as 'Testing used to co-ordinate multiple test levels or test types' |    |     |
|  3| "Expert Checks Output" is an antipattern for automated testing. Tests should check their own results and report pass or fail without any need for an expert. |    |     |
|  4| You should have at least one unit test for each code branch in the unit under test. |    |     |
|  5| If you test several code units together in the same test, this test will be more fragile and costly to maintain compared with several unit tests, each focussed on one unit |    |     |
|  6| Testing happens at the end of an agile project |    |     |
|  7| If you over-specify a test, that means it is fragile and will break often. |    |     |
|  8| There are two kinds of integration tests - 'broad' and 'narrow'. |    |     |
|  9| Black-box unit tests depend on the implementation details of the unit under test. |    |     |
| 10| Branch-testing is a white-box testing technique |    |     |
| 11| Exploratory testing can be automated |    |     |
| 12| Pairwise testing exercises pairs of parameter values |    |     |
| 13| Data-driven testing uses data files to contain test data and also the expected results of each test |    |     |
| 14| Snapshot testing is the same as Golden Master testing |    |     |
| 15| Developers should not do testing, you need testers who are independent from the implementation  |    |     |
| 16| Capture-replay GUI testing helps you to get going quickly but generally creates fragile, unmaintainable test cases |    |     |
