# Code Coverage - Warm-Up Questions

Mark each statement below as true or false. After the session, come back to this quiz and change any answers you feel are incorrect and add detail to your answers.

|  1| Code coverage measures what proportion of lines of code are executed when you run your tests.                             |    |     |
|  2| You should generally aim for 80% coverage accross your whole codebase.                                                    |    |     |
|  3| Lines of code that are not covered will contain bugs.                                                                     |    |     |
|  4| You should automatically prevent code from being merged to the master branch if coverage is too low.                      |    |     |
|  5| Lines of code that are covered will not contain bugs.                                                                     |    |     |
|  6| Code coverage calculations take a lot of CPU and will slow down your build if you include them.                           |    |     |
|  7| 100% Branch coverage is harder to achieve than 100% statement coverage.                                                   |    |     |
|  8| If you have 100% coverage you should feel confident in the quality of your tests                                          |    |     |
|  9| If you have less than 10% coverage you should feel concerned about the quality of your tests.                             |    |     |
| 10| You should plot a graph over time showing whether coverage is going up or down, and use it in team retrospectives.        |    |     |
| 11| The best time to gather code coverage data is when all development work is finished.                                      |    |     |
| 12| If may not be possible to achieve 100% coverage due to dead code.                                                         |    |     |
| 13| You should use an IDE rather than a text editor so you can see coverage data interactively as you code.                   |    |     |
| 14| Code coverage shows you where you are missing test cases.                                                                 |    |     |
| 15| Code coverage is an essential metric for a Test Manager but developers need not be concerned with it.                     |    |     |
| 16| Code coverage is useful for adding tests to existing code but not that useful when you do TDD.                            |    |     |
