Shopping Basket Discount
========================

Calculate the total price of a shopping basket. Items
in the basket have a unit price and quantity.

For example:

- price $10, quantity 5
- price $25, quantity 2
- price $9.99, quantity 6

If you buy in bulk, you get a discount:

- If total value > $100, apply a 5% discount
- If total value > $200, apply a 10% discount
