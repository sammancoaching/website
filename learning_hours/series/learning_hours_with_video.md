# Learning Hours with accompanying video
These learning hours have been made into a video you can show in your session, or simply use as inspiration. The names in this list refer to the video title, although the links go to pages on this site. You can also view this as a [playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GpAlmbnHyAEyVy5S9ZrJSMrbsn4dg6W). There is also a video that [explains how to use these videos](https://youtu.be/7dnKYg4lkzI).
