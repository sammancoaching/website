# Ensemble - Definition

Ensemble - when a whole team works together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer.

You call it _Ensemble Programming_ when you're working on a programming task, and _Ensemble Testing_ when it's a testing task. Generally we call it _Ensemble Working_, or simply _Ensemble_.

The term _Ensemble Programming_ is a synonym for [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming) or [Software Teaming](https://woodyzuill.com/home/software-teaming-mob-programming/). In Samman Coaching, we prefer to use the word "Ensemble" because it sounds friendly. 

When you have a team working together well in an ensemble, it gives everyone a good chance to share knowledge and raise the quality of the work being done. For a team new to ensemble it helps to have a facilitator, for example a Samman technical coach. More experienced teams may not need anyone explicitly in this role. 

The main ensemble roles are:

* **Typing** - the person with the keyboard, controlling the development tools and entering the code into the computer.
* **Talking** - the person leading the work by explaining the goals and intended direction to the person typing.
* **Supporting** - the role of everyone else in the ensemble who is contributing to the work. The main tasks are to review the work as it happens, ask relevant questions and offer improvement suggestions.

Usually everyone rotates through all of these roles on a timescale of 3-10 minutes.


## Aside: Reasons to say "Ensemble" instead of "Mob"

- _Ensemble_ has positive connotations and calls to mind a group of musicians creating something beautiful together.
- _Ensemble working_ is inclusive of testing and testers.
- _Mob_ is the kind of attention grabbing, controversial term that attracts early adopters, much like "eXtreme Programming". It may not attract the early majority or the late majority. It may not be a good term to use in the kind of corporate settings where many technical coaches work.
- “Mobbing” in Swedish and German sounds similar to the word for "bullying"
