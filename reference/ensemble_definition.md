# Ensemble Working - Definition

Ensemble working - when a whole team works together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, on the same computer.

You call it _Ensemble Programming_ when you're working on a programming task, and _Ensemble Testing_ when it's a testing task.

The term _Ensemble Programming_ is a synonym for [Mob Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming): it's the same thing. In Samman coaching, we prefer to use the word "Ensemble" because it sounds more friendly. 

## Reasons to say "Ensemble" instead of "Mob"

- _Ensemble_ has positive connotations and calls to mind a group of musicians creating something beautiful together.
- _Ensemble working_ is inclusive of testing and testers.
- _Mob_ is the kind of attention grabbing, controversial term that attracts early adopters, much like "eXtreme Programming". It may not attract the early majority or the late majority. It may not be a good term to use in the kind of corporate settings where many technical coaches work.
- “Mobbing” in Swedish and German sounds similar to the word for "bullying"
