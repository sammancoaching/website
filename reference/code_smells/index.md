# Code Smells

This is a collection of descriptions of Code Smells intended as a reference to use during learning hours and other technical coaching activities. Although these descriptions are original and authored specifically for this site, many of the names are taken from Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring" 2nd Edition. 

You can read more about code smells in general in Martin Fowler's article [Code Smells](https://www.martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html) and on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell).
