# Refactorings

This is a collection of descriptions of [Refactorings](https://refactoring.com/). The descriptions are original to this site although many of the names are taken from Martin Fowler's book "Refactoring" 2nd Edition.

## Refactoring structure
Each refactoring is described using the structure "Identify - Prepare - Refactor - Clean - Follow up".

* Identify - find the program element(s) you want to transform.
* Prepare - before you do the transformation, work on making that change easier. This can mean researching the impact of the planned change, or doing some preparatory refactorings to make it easier.
* Refactor - follow these steps to complete the design transformation.
* Clean - remove any preparations or scaffolding that is not needed now the refactoring is completed.
* Follow up - suggestions of further refactoring steps that are now possible.

## IDE Support
In some cases the refactoring descriptions includes references to ways your IDE can help you do them more safely. This is intended to help you use your tools better, but be warned - IDEs differ in details and are frequently updated. Descriptions may not always be entirely correct. If there is a note your IDE can help you but yours doesn't seem to do that, look around the menus and see if the assistance is there just under another name.

In the JetBrains family of tools I recommend looking in these three menus when you right click on a program element:
* "Context Actions".
* "Refactor This" - also available on the top level "Refactor" menu.
* "Generate" - also available on the top level "Code" menu.

Once you've found the option you want, I recommend learning the keyboard shortcut for it.
