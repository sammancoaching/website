# The Mission of the Samman Society

Our mission is to promote and develop Samman Technical Coaching and support people everywhere who work as [technical coaches](
{% link reference/technical_coach_definition.md %}) with resources and opportunities to meet other coaches. We are continually learning and using better ways to help individuals and teams to adopt the technical practices that enable iterative and incremental software development. 

The Samman Technical Coaching Society is a not-for-profit organization based in Sweden. The society owns the domain name 'sammancoaching.org' and the brand 'Samman Coaching' and protects these from misuse by third parties. Details of the society's trademark registration are available in the [EUIPO database](https://www.euipo.europa.eu/). 

You do not have to join the society in order to use this website or attend society events. We do not offer certification as a Samman coach. However, membership of the society is only offered to technical coaches who have demonstrated their ability to use the Samman method, and who we are prepared to recommend.
