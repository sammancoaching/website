# The Mission of the Samman Society

The Samman Technical Coaching Society is a not-for-profit organization based in Sweden. Its mission is to promote and develop Samman Technical Coaching and in particular support people who work as technical coaches with resources and opportunities to meet other coaches. The society owns the domain name 'sammancoaching.org' and the brand 'Samman Coaching' and protects these from misuse by third parties.

You do not have to join the society in order to use this website or attend society events. We do not offer certification as a Samman coach. However, membership of the society is only offered to technical coaches who have demonstrated their ability to use the Samman method, and who we are prepared to recommend.
