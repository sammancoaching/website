# About the Samman Technical Coaching Society

The Samman Technical Coaching Society is a not-for-profit organization based in Sweden. Its mission is to promote and develop Samman Technical Coaching and in particular support people who work as technical coaches with resources and opportunities to meet other coaches. The society owns the domain name ‘sammancoaching.org’ and the brand ‘Samman Coaching’ and protects these from misuse by third parties.

You do not have to join the society in order to use this website or attend society events. We do not offer certification as a Samman coach. However, membership of the society is only offered to technical coaches who have demonstrated their ability to use the Samman method.

You don't need to be a member of the society to author learning hours, but you will need to pair with a member to get them published here. If you have something you'd like to contribute then please [contact us](/contact.html). You could also get to know us by attending a course. Training is offered via partner organizations, and you can find out what courses are available on our [Training](training.html) page. Organizations can also [sponsor](sponsorship.html) the society.

The primary benefit of joining the society is to get a say in how the practice of Samman coaching develops in the future. You can influence the kinds of materials and activities that we invest in, and the sponsorship that we accept. You can publish your materials to this site and have your name listed on the [member page](contributors/index.html).

The Executive Board of the society only offers membership to people who have the ability to act as a Samman coach. A Samman coach is competent with techniques that enable iterative and incremental software development, for example Test Driven Development. A Samman coach has the ability to teach others these techniques in a pedagogical and engaging way. A Samman coach has the ability to act as mentor and facilitator for Ensemble working. If you are interested in joining the society, please [contact us](/contact.html).
