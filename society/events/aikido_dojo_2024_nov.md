# Samman Coaching Society Verbal Aikido Dojo

**Friday 29th November 2024, 16:00 Stockholm/Berlin**

_Practice and improve your verbal aikido skills together with other technical coaches._

This is a regular one hour online [Verbal Aikido®](https://verbalaikido.org/) dojo hosted by [Philippe Bourgau]({% link society/contributors/philou.md %}). We will hold 4 weekly sessions during November, we hope you will come to all of them, there is no charge. Fill in the form lower down on this page to sign up and receive a meeting link by email.

[Verbal Aikido®](https://verbalaikido.org/) is an effective and peaceful means to deal with verbal attacks and negativity. As a technical coach, Philippe Bourgau has found it very useful for handling stressful situations and making it easier for developers to feel safe and proud of their work. Verbal Aikido is a practical skill so the best way to learn it is through practice and feedback together with others. 

We will begin with four weekly online "dojo" sessions kindly hosted by Philippe. Times are Stockholm/Berlin - use [this link](https://calndr.link/event/IX80SxfSoU) to add the next event to your calendar in your timezone. We plan a total of 4 weekly events during November 2024.
