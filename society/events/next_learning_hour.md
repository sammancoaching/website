This is a monthly, 90-minute meeting usually held on a Wednesday starting at 17:00 Stockholm/Paris/Berlin. We use this time to try out a new learning hour before it is published on the website. The presenter gets qualified feedback from other coaches.  Hosted by [Emily Bache]({% link society/contributors/emilybache.md %}).

These events are open to [Members]({% link society/membership.md %}), [Supporters]({% link society/supporters.md %}) and [Contributors]({% link society/contributors/index.md %}). The joining details are published on our Discord.

If you would like to get involved in the work of the society, we recommend you join one of our [Open Space]({% link society/events/next_open_space.md %}) events
so you can introduce yourself and find out more.
