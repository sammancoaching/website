# Samman Coaching Society Learning Hour Events

_Preview new learning hours designed by society members and supporters._

This is a monthly, 90-minute meeting. This event is accessible to society contributers and supporters. Hosted by [Emily Bache]({% link society/contributors/emilybache.md %}). 
The joining details are published on our Discord.

We use this time to try out a new learning hour before it is published on the website. The presenter gets qualified feedback from other coaches.

If you think this is something you would like to participate in, then contributing and supporting some of our open events, such as the [Open Space]({% link society/events/next_open_space.md %})
is the best way to introduce yourself and find out more.

This event is also open to [Patreon Supporters](https://www.patreon.com/EmilyBache).
