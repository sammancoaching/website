# Samman Coaching Society Online Open Space Events

_Bring your questions and exchange experiences with other technical coaches._

The Samman Society hosts one hour online open space events approximately once a month. You can find the next one listed on the [Events]({% link society/events/index.md %}) page. Usually people sign up for one event at a time. This page lets you sign up for all future events. 

If you fill in the form lower down on this page you will receive a meeting link by email every time we hold an open space event. This email will also include a link to unsubscribe if you no longer wish to receive these emails.
