# Samman Coaching Society Ensemble

_Support the Society and Collaborate with Other Coaches._

This is a weekly, 1 hour ensemble. This event is accessible to society contributers and supporters. Hosted by [Emily Bache]({% link society/contributors/emilybache.md %}). 
The joining details are published on our Discord.

We use this time to collaborate with our friends in the industry, where a diverse range of skills are brought to the room and we have fun writing code using ensemble techniques.

If you think this is something you would like to participate in, then contributing and supporting some of our open events, such as the [Open Space]({% link society/events/next_open_space.md %})
is the best way to introduce yourself and find out more.

This event is also open to [Patreon Supporters](https://www.patreon.com/EmilyBache).
