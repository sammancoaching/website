# Samman Coaching Society Ensemble Events

_Support the Society and Collaborate with Other Coaches._

This is a weekly, 1 hour ensemble. We use this time to collaborate with our friends in the industry, where a diverse range of skills are brought to the room and we have fun writing code using ensemble techniques.  Hosted by [Emily Bache]({% link society/contributors/emilybache.md %}).

This event is open to [Members]({% link society/membership.md %}), [Supporters]({% link society/supporters.md %}) and [Contributors]({% link society/contributors/index.md %}). The joining details are published on our Discord.

If you would like to get involved in the work of the society, we recommend you join one of our [Open Space]({% link society/events/next_open_space.md %}) events
so you can introduce yourself and find out more.
