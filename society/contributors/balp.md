{{author.title}} is a {{page.role}} at [HiQ](https://www.hiq.se) focusing on developing developers.

Anders has been working with helping developers evolve in the skills they use in their daily jobs since he read the book "Extreme Programing Explained" back in 2000. Through the Python user group in Gothenburg he met Emily and started to run his first coding dojos, and then later began Samman-inspired coaching in his workplace.
