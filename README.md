## Development

To test locally:

    bundle exec jekyll serve

Instead of using jekyll locally you can get a prebuilt docker image with Ruby, Jekyll etc. installed:

    dockerinit

Test locally run the server with:

    dockerrun

Alternatively use [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) using the docker-compose.yml. 
    
    docker-compose up

Then browse to:

    http://localhost:4000

If you want to get access to the terminal in the docker container the command is:

    docker exec -it <name_of_container> /bin/bash

were "name_of_container"  is found by running the command 

    docker ls

or expanding the container in the Docker desktop user interface.

## Deploying to the live site
When you push to the main branch, there is a github action that deploys the changes.
