# Guided Learning Hours - Samman Coaching Training
_Attend learning hours with an experienced facilitator_

You will take part in learning hours led by an experienced technical coach from the Samman Society. Guided Learning Hours are based on [the videos by Emily Bache](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7GpAlmbnHyAEyVy5S9ZrJSMrbsn4dg6W). You are guided through these materials by an experienced facilitator, learning practical coding skills in a group. Afterwards, you gain a license to use these materials to train your own team.

## Session topics
There are several themes available, including:
* Refactoring towards better Object-Oriented Design
* Test Design and using Mocks
* Legacy Code
* Incremental development

For company-internal training you can choose the exact sessions. For public training the topics are published alongside the course dates.

## Equipping you to lead these sessions afterwards
This training is designed to support senior developers working towards milestone 1 in the [Samman Learning Hour Career Track]({% link society/learning_hour_milestones.md %}). The idea is you learn the materials and are afterwards able to lead learning hours in your own organization based on them. 

After each learning hour there is an optional Session Briefing and Q&A with your host. If you haven't facilitated or led training before then it can be a little daunting to just call a meeting and ask your team to go through a Learning Hour with you as host. This online training can help demystify the experience.

## Dates and times:
There are currently no public dates scheduled, please [Contact us]({% link contact.md %}) to register your interest in the next course or to enquire about company-internal training. You could also sign up for our [Newsletter]({% link newsletter.md %}).

For more detailed advice about leading learning hours with your team, we recommend you follow-up this training by attending the course [Deliver Learning Hours]({% link training/deliver_learning_hours.md %}). 

Emily Bache also offers a package for companies looking to train a group of senior developers in technical coaching skills, based on these kinds of videos: ["Foundations of Software Craft"](https://emilybache.com/foundations-of-software-craft/)
