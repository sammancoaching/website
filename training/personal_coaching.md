# Personal one-on-one mentoring and Train-the-trainer

We begin by dentifying and assessing the support relevant for you personally in your journey as a technical coach. We'll discuss your previous experiences, challenges and aspirations. Based on this initial session we hope to be able to recommend training courses to attend, books to read and other activities to take part in.

The next stages of the mentoring will be tailored for your situation. As you gain in skill and experience we expect you will move from observing the experienced coach towards doing these activities independently. For example the progression could look like this:

* Observing the experienced coach leading a learning hour or ensemble session and discussing afterwards _(I do)_
* Pair-coaching and running learning hour and ensemble sessions together _(We do)_
* Feedback on your learning hour plans & observing the sessions you lead _(You do with support)_
* On-call support when you run into unfamiliar or difficult situations _(You do and improve)_

The exact details and hourly prices will be agreed between the specific coach and the mentee. There may be additional costs for materials provided by the coach such as videos, activity boards and coding exercises.

You can find a list of members of the Samman Society below, and any of us would be able to provide this kind of mentoring service. Send us a message via our [Contact us]({% link contact.md %}) page and mention which coach(es) you would like to meet.
