# Introducing Ensemble - Samman Coaching Training

_set up for team success_

[Ensemble]({% link reference/ensemble_definition.md %}) is one of the core activities in Samman Coaching. This training is designed for senior developers who have experience of being in a well-facilitated ensemble, and want to introduce this way of working to teams who are new to it.

Before a team will be able to work smoothly in an ensemble you usually need to explain the structure, roles, and underlying principles. They will also need some hands-on practice working this way with a straightforward piece of code before they tackle the complexity of their production code. This course introduces all the important aspects for successful ensemble in a structured way that is tried and tested.

The idea is that later on you’d be able to use the course materials to repeat this same training with any teams you are part of or are coaching. We want to set you up for success both as a team member introducing ensemble to your colleagues, or as a coach introducing ensemble to an unfamiliar group.

This training is highly interactive and participatory.

## Course Topics:

* Creating a safe, engaging coding environment with your team
* Ensemble roles, rotations and structure
* Practical tips to improve communication and collaboration

This course is designed to support senior developers working towards milestone 3 in the [Samman Ensemble Career Track]({% link society/ensemble_milestones.md %}). You will come away with the knowledge you need to introduce ensemble working to your colleagues.
