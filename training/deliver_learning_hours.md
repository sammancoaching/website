# Deliver Learning Hours - Samman Coaching Training
_Lead learning hours with your team_

Would you like to lead some learning hours with your team, but you need help getting started? The Samman Society provides materials that can give you a real jump-start as a technical coach, but you might still want some help learning how to make best use of them. With only a little preparation, all kinds of developers and coaches can put on a valuable session for their team, and this course will take you to the next level. We will explain the teaching techniques and design principles that lie behind the Samman Society learning hour materials. Our aim is to set you up for success leading these sessions, and give you a chance to learn from more experienced coaches.

The training is held online in three parts, held over a period of 3-4 weeks. Between sessions you can expect to spend 1-2 hours on study and preparation. You will prepare and lead a learning hour for the group, as well as take part in sessions led by other participants. You’ll get hands-on practice using the skills you're learning, and the chance to network with, and learn from, other coaches on the same journey as you.

## Course Topics:

* How Learning Hours are used as part of the Samman Technical Coaching method
* Sharon Bowman's 4C teaching model
* Setting learning goals
* Facilitation skills for interactive learning activities
* Adapting materials and activities for the needs of your team

This course is an introduction. You will come away with the knowledge you need to lead learning hours with your colleagues, using materials that have been developed by others. If you’re an experienced trainer in other contexts already, then this course will also set you on the path to begin designing and leading learning hours from your own materials. If you’re less experienced with teaching and coaching, we plan to offer a follow-up course later on that will help you to design your own materials.

This online training is highly interactive and participatory, and is normally led by a pair of experienced coaches from the Samman Technical Coaching Society.
