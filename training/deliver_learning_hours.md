Would you like to lead some learning hours with your team, but you need a little more help getting started? With only a little preparation, all kinds of developers and coaches can put on a valuable session for their team, using materials available online. In order to get the best out of the Samman Society learning hour materials it helps to understand the eaching techniques and design principles that lie behind them. This course is designed to set you up for success leading these sessions, and gives you a chance to learn from more experienced coaches.

## Course Topics:

* How Learning Hours are used as part of the Samman Technical Coaching method
* Sharon Bowman's 4C teaching model
* Setting learning goals
* Facilitation skills for interactive learning activities

This course is an introduction. You will come away with the knowledge you need to lead learning hours with your colleagues, using materials that have been developed by others. If you’re an experienced trainer in other contexts already, then this course will also set you on the path to begin designing and leading learning hours from your own materials. There is a follow-up course [Learning Hours Masterclass]({% link training/learning_hours_masterclass.md %}) that will help you to take the next steps.

This online training is highly interactive and participatory, and is normally led by a pair of experienced coaches from the Samman Technical Coaching Society.
