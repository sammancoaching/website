# Describe Your Experience

- Time: 5 - 10 minutes

Split into pairs for about 5 minutes with a discussion prompt like this: 

* "Describe your experience with _\<the topic\>_. Does anything stand out to you as working really well?"

Ask them to write notes to summarize what works well and share those notes with the group.

When the time is up, talk through the notes and highlight any experiences which match up with what you'd like to talk more about in the next section.

For example, if your learning hour is about breaking dependencies, you could use 'Flaky tests' as the topic. Then highlight any experiences that talk about redesigning code to make it easier to test.

## Benefits
The idea is to connect to a problem which people already are familiar with, and their own experiences of what works well. People like talking about their own experiences, and hopefully some people will share relevant solutions that you can build on. This Connect activity can help you to motivate why a particular problem is worth solving.
