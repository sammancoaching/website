# Note down your most important takeaways

- Time: 3-5 minutes

Give everyone a pen and sticky note (or a link to a shared document or online whiteboard) and ask them to note down an answer to a question like this (pick the question you find most appropriate).

* What is the most important thing you learnt today about _the topic_?
* What facts or ideas about _the topic_ are most important to remember?
* What would you tell a colleague about this training? What would be important to mention?

Encourage them to take the note with them and stick it on their desk, (or take a screenshot of the document and keep it on their computer desktop) for a week.

## Benefits
The idea is to help them remember the most important things they learnt. The learning is reinforced by putting it into their own words, and placing it somewhere they will read it again during the week.
