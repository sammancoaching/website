# Popcorn Feedback

- Time: 3 minutes

Collect feedback quickly and informally.

## How to

Facilitator presents the popcorn feedback format:

> _Do you know when you put popcorn in the microwave and you wait for the popping to start? When it starts, the popcorn pops at irregular intervals, sometimes a few pops in quick succession, sometimes a longer pause. This is how we will give feedback now. When you have something to say, just 'pop' up and share your thought. It should be fast, so don't overthink it. So, "Pop while it's Hot!", speak out your thought in the moment! Dont hesitate!_

Then they ask the question.
