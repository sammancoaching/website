# How does it feel when we use this technique?

- Time: 2 minutes

Now that they have tried out a new technique, ask them how does it feel to work this way?

Gather responses by asking them to:
- Choose an emoji to stick on the board (Give them a selection of emojis to choose from)
- Write a word or sentence describing a feeling on a sticky note


## Benefits
If the experience of using the technique was fun, or easier than what they're used to, get them to acknowledge that feeling. It might motivate them to make the changes so they could use this technique in their production code.
