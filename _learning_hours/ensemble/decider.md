# The Decider Protocol in Ensemble Programming

* **Theme:** Collaboration & Decision-Making in the Ensemble
* **Duration:** ~60 minutes
* **Level:** Intermediate (teams already doing ensemble or pairing)

## 🎯 Learning Goals

By the end of this session, participants will:

1. Understand the **purpose and steps** of the Decider Protocol.
2. Practice making **small, structured team decisions** quickly and inclusively.
3. Learn when to trigger a Decider during ensemble work to keep flow.
4. End the session with a **shared commitment**: when and how they will try it from now on.

## 1️⃣ Connect: Decision Friction Mini-Retro (10 min)

Ask:

> _Think of a recent moment when your team got stuck deciding something (in an ensemble, a meeting, or even in chat). What keywords would you use to describe the situation and the consequences?_

1. **1 min alone:** answer by yourself in silence.
2. **2 min pairs:** share and select a group answer.
3. **4 min pairs of pairs:** same thing.
4. **All:** [popcorn share]({% link _activities/conclusions/popcorn_feedback.md %}), write down group answers.

Note: In remote, use the 1-3-all format.

Bridge:

> _Today we’ll explore a quick way to make clear, safe decisions so we can move forward together — the **Decider Protocol**._

## 2️⃣ Concept: Demo & walk-through (10 min)

### Mini-explanation (5 min)

Show or read the **five steps** of the Decider Protocol:

1. **Propose:** someone says “I propose …” (small, concrete, actionable).
2. **Clarify:** short Q&A (max 1 min).
3. **Vote:** everyone shows one hand at once (vote as if alone):

   * 👍 → Yes
   * 🤜 → Support it ()"I can live with this proposal", "I think it's the best we have right now" "I support it even if I have few caveats that I might raise later when I know more")
   * 👎 → Block (Avoid blocking for minor stuff)

4. **Integrate:** 

    * If majority of 👎 and 🤜 → Drop the proposal 🗑.
    * Otherwise, for any 👎, ask each dissenter what must change to get to 🤜/👍, no arguing. Modify → re-vote ⚒.
5. **Act:** when all are 👍 or 🤜 →  GO ✅!

### Demo (5 min total)

Facilitator runs one quick example with everyone:

> “I propose that we code in silence for 10 minutes”
> Walk through Clarify → Vote → Integrate → Act.

Discuss: _What are your first impressions?_ Use the [popcorn share]({% link _activities/conclusions/popcorn_feedback.md %}) to collect answers.

Note: If the team already knows the [Emoji Protocol or 1-2-4-All]({% link _learning_hours/ensemble/emojies_and_124all_design.md %}), mention briefly that Decider complements these very well. Otherwise, skip.

## 3️⃣ Concrete: Practice in short, realistic rounds (30 min)

### Setup:

Show a short, messy code snippet.

> “We’ll use the Decider Protocol to choose how we’d refactor this.”

As a reference, with a team of system testers, we used ["Uglified Tests" from the Supermarket Kata](https://github.com/philou/Supermarket-TestDesign-Kata/tree/ugly_tests).

Tip: LLMs are really good at making code messier!

### Decide:

Run as many Decider cycles as you can:

1. Anyone can propose a refactor or improvement (rename, extract, add helper…). Make sure proposals are small and concrete (variable name, fixture style, etc.).
2. Go through the full Decider steps. As a facilitator, model the timing discipline, aim for flow and repetition so that the protocols becomes fast. (As a reference, we managed to run 6 decider cycles the first time we ran the learning hour)
3. Visualy capture the results in two groups of "Aggreed improvements" and "Rejected improvements".

### 1-2-4-All Option:

If the team did the [Emojies and 1-2-4-All-Design]({% link _learning_hours/ensemble/emojies_and_124all_design.md %}) Learning Hour before, start with a 1-2-4-All-Design round to generate improvement proposals, then ask each group to trigger a Decider on their favorite proposal in turn.

## 4️⃣ Conclusions: Feedback and Propositions (10 min)

### Collect Feedback

Ask the following questions:

> _What did you notice about speed, safety, inclusion? How did it feel to commit and move on? Do you have any question about the practice?_

Collect answers and record them visually.

### Propositions

Remind them:

> “We don’t need every decision to be perfect. We just need to decide safely and move forward.”

Then ask:

> _What do you propose to try in the ensemble?_

Wait for team members to come up with propositions, and make them use the decider. They should come with 1 or 2 tweaks to the decider to try in the ensemble.

## 💡 Optional Extensions & References

If the team already practiced [**1-2-4-All** and **Emoji Protocols**]({% link _learning_hours/ensemble/emojies_and_124all_design.md %}), combine them naturally:

* 🏗 → pause for design → 1-2-4-All → Decider → Act.
* Otherwise, this learning hour stands completely on its own.

The Decider is one of the Core Protocols, can find more details here: [Decider Protocol](https://thecoreprotocols.org/protocols/decider).
