# Stubbing Dependencies
We already met a first stub in the [test doubles intro](test_double_intro.html). Here we look at using a mocking framework and follow up with another exercise that needs a stub.

### Connect - Mocking frameworks
What mocking frameworks have you used? Which one(s) do you use in your current codebase? Do a [Web Hunt]({% link _activities/connect/webhunt.md %}) and look for resources and documentation for your preferred mocking framework. Can you use it to create a Stub?

### Concept - Stub with a mocking framework
Recap when you might want to use a stub - to replace an awkward dependency. Demo how to create a stub in their preferred mocking framework.

### Concrete 
Do [Tire Pressure](https://github.com/emilybache/TirePressure-Kata) again, this time using the mocking framework.

If they finish this task quickly, ask them to work on [Turn Ticket](https://github.com/emilybache/TurnTicket-Kata).

### Conclusions
List some benefits from using a mocking framework over hand-coding your stubs. Are there any disadvantages to using the mocking framework?
