# Refactoring Golf
Minimize the number of steps to get from A to B. Should encourage you to use more keyboard shortcuts.

## Learning Goals

* use keyboard shortcuts for refactoring with fluency
* recognize when to use refactorings like 'extract function', 'move method' and 'change signature'

## Session Outline

The exercises are in the [RefactoringGolf](https://github.com/emilybache/RefactoringGolf) repo.
