# Keyboarding skills

Exercises to increase fluency with refactoring by practicing using keyboard shortcuts more.

## Learning Goals

* Use keyboard shortcuts for Move Line, Inline, Multiple Cursors, Expand Selection
* Identify what happens when you do 'inline' on methods and variables

## Session Outline

* 2 min connect: keyboard shortcuts you use a lot
* 10 mins concept and do: Move Line
* 10 mins concept and do: Navigation
* 10 mins concept and do: Inline
* 10 mins concept and do: Multi Cursor
* 10 mins concept and do: Expand Selection
* 2 min reflect: note most useful shortcuts

### Connect: keyboard shortcuts you use a lot
What are the keyboard shortcuts that you use the most while coding? Dot voting, up to 5 votes each:

* Copy
* Cut
* Paste
* Move Line
* Expand Selection
* Rename
* Extract Method/Function
* Delete
* Introduce Variable
* Create Cursor/Caret
* Inline
* Navigate to definition
* Find Usages
* Introduce Constant
* Undo
* Bold text
* Find in files
* Comment lines

The goal is just to remind people they already know some shortcuts, even if it's only Ctrl-C for copy and Ctrl-V for paste.

### Concept and do
Use the [Keyboard Shortcut Katas](https://github.com/emilybache/KeyboardShortcutKatas.Net). The five sections are listed in the README. For each one, present the challenge, get people to identify the relevant keyboard shortcuts, and let them work on it individually.

### Conclusions
Get a sticky note to keep next to your screen. Note down on it one or two keyboard shortcuts that you will try to use more often now.
