# Learn Faster By Practicing Teaching

## Learning Outcome

 * Practice Teaching
 * Learn that Teaching is a great way of Learning

 
## Session Outline

* 5 min connect: What is Learning? How do you learn best?
* 10 min concept: Use a picture of the "Learning Pyramid"
* 30 min concrete: Participants get time to prepare a topic and teach it back.
* 10 min conclusions: Was this valuable? How can we continue this?

  
### Connect: 
Two topics I would recommend to connect to:
 
  1. What does "*I learn something*" mean?   
     What is different afterwards?  

  2. How do you learn best?  


### Concept: Learning
Pre-requisite: Search for alternatives to this image:    
  [Learning Pyramid Search](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=learning%20pyramid)  
  **Tips**: 
  _There are lots of different versions of this model.  
  Find one that suits your teaching style and that you can share in your organisation (documentation)._
  
  

1. Show this model (or your alternative)  
   ![Learning Pyramid](/assets/images/Learning-Pyramid-Training-Material.png)  

2. Explain it :)  
   Make the teaching as interactive as possible, by asking questions around the model (or your favourite teaching style)
3. Advanced (if time): Do you practice in a safe environment? (kata?) or in Production code? 
    How?
  

### Concrete: Teach Back

  Participants get time to prepare a topic and teach it back.
  
1. 2min: Collect Topics (*or prepare them: KISS; YAGNI; SRP, RestAssured, RuleOf3, CAP Theory, OpenTelemetry, ...Whatever is buzzing in the team*)
2. 1min: Everyone grabs 1 topic 
3. 15min: Everyone prepares 
4. 1.5min: Everyone does short teach back 
5. Group gives feedback (Fist of 5) 
   
**Fist of 5**: Everyone uses their hand to rate the teach back.   
1=Disaster, 5=Perfect, all the others (2,3,4) are somewhere between disaster and perfect.  
Everyone should be prepared to answer the followup question: _"What could the teacher improve to make it perfect (=5) for you?"_
       
  
#### Tips For Teach Back:  
  * Find and use a picture
  * Find code samples and use them
    
    
Explain 
  * the "*What*"
  * "*What for?*"
  * "*Why is this important?*"
  * "*What are alternatives?*"


### Conclusions: 
[Collect Round Robin]({% link _activities/conclusions/collect_round_robin.md %}):

 * Your Aha! on a Meta Level  
 * What should we do with this?
