# Learn Faster By Practicing Teaching

## Learning Outcome

 * Practice Teaching
 * Learn that Teaching is a great way of Learning

 
## Session Outline

* 5 min connect: What is Learning? How do you learn best?
* 10 min concept: Use a picture of the "Learning Pyramid"
* 30 min concrete: Participants get time to prepare a topic and teach it back.
* 10 min conclusions: Was this valuable? How can we continue this?

  
### Connect: 
Two topics I would recommend to connect to:
 
  1. #ELI5   
     What does "*I learn something*" mean?   
     What is different afterwards?  

  2. How do you learn best?  

*PS: #ELI5 = Explain It Like I'm 5.*

### Concept: Learning
Pre-requisite: Search for alternatives to this image:    
  [Learning Pyramid Search](https://www.ecosia.org/images?q=learning%20pyramid)  

1. Show this model (or your alternative)  
   ![Learning Pyramid](/assets/images/Learning-Pyramid-Training-Material.png)  

2. Explain it :)  
3. Advanced (if time): Do you practice in a safe environment? (kata?) or in Production code? 
    How?
  

### Concrete: Teach Back

  Participants get time to prepare a topic and teach it back.
  
1. 2min: Collect Topics (*or prepare them: KISS; YAGNI; SRP, RestAssured, RuleOf3, CAP Theory, OpenTelemetry, ...Whatever is buzzing in the team*)
2. 1min: Everyone grabs 1 topic 
3. 15min: Everyone prepares 
4. 1.5min: Everyone does short teach back 
5. Group gives feedback (Fist of 5) 
       
  
#### Tips:  
  * Find and use a picture
  * Find code samples and use them
    
    
Explain 
  * the "*What*"
  * "*What for?*"
  * "*Why is this important?*"
  * "*What are alternatives?*"


### Conclusions: 
[Collect Round Robin]({% link _activities/conclusions/collect_round_robin.md %}):

 * Your Aha! on a Meta Level  
 * What should we do with this?
