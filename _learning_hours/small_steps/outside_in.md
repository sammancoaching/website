# Outside-in TDD

This learning hour is still being worked on.

When youâ€™re doing TDD and you have an outer-loop "Guiding Test" defined, you can choose to work outside-in on the inner loop TDD. I wrote [an article](http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/outside-in-development-with-double-loop-tdd/) that explains more details.

Many programmers over-use mocks and in this learning hour we look at how the inventors of mocks intended them to be used.
