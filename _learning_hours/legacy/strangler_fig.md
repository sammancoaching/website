# Strangler Fig Pattern

Martin Fowler, author of "Refactoring" and signatory of the Agile Manifesto, created this analogy with the [Strangler Fig](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/StranglerFigApplication.html). He was imagining a legacy application gradually being replaced by a new system. A hallmark of the approach is that for a while in the middle, both the old and the new system co-exist. 

TODO: create a good exercise for this

## Connect: how bad was the worst code you ever worked with? 

Pose this question: Have you ever worked on code that was so bad it made you want to find a new job?

## Concept: Martin Fowler's strangler fig article
